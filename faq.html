						  <h2 class="faq">How does affect installation without GPS antenna on the system?</h2>
						  <center><p>We strongly recommend to use GPS antenna, however it possible to work without it ,but it's may cause the problem of cell phone registration to the network in terms of surrounding GSM networks, cell phone model, temperature. Once the phone has registered to network, GPS does not affect on productivity of the system at all.</p></center>

						  <h2 class="faq">Do you have a specific simcards or usual simcards can be used?

</h2>
						  <center><p>Fairwaves base station could be configured to work with any SIM-cards. However it is impossible to provide subscriber authentication and traffic encryption if you do not know Ki secret key of your SIM-cards. If you operate a normal mobile network with encryption and subscriber authentication,you can set up only open network either get SIM-cards with known Ki keys to set up close network. You can buy a SIM-cards and program them.</p></center>

						  <h2 class="faq">What is capacity of the subscriber database?

</h2>
						  <center><p>A base station with one transceiver are able to handle from 200 subscribers (if you offer your subscribers a flat tariff with free local calls) to 500 (normal mode with tariffs still comfortable for subscribers). For example, with 10 000 subscribers you will need around 20 base stations. Please note this is very rough estimation.</p></center>

						  <center><p> Fairwaves base stations are able to provide basic services: Voice and SMS also Fairwaves provide GPRS, in terms of quality it disabled in production systems to get more capacity for the voice and SMS either that is too slow to use it as data service. We considering to use WiFi instead of GPRS.

It does not have local calls switching, there is no a simple ways of backhaul optimization, that brings an extra expenses for the village connection through the VSAT.</p></center>

						  <h2 class="faq"> TRX0 frequency spectrum detected but TRX1 does not seem to be transmitting on the specified frequency. what is could be the issue?

</h2>
						  <center><p>According to the GSM Standard, only TRX0 has to transmit constantly.
Secondary TRX's can transmit only when TRX0 would completely loaded.

So if you want to see transmission on the TRX1 you should either:
<br>
1. have more than 6 active call legs (more than 3 acive calls)
<br>
2. set TRX0 configuration to SDCCH and leave TCH only on the TRX1 and make a call.
<br>
In other case you'll see that the transmission of TRX1 is not
continuous, unless you have all TCH's on TRX1.</p></center>

						  <h2 class="faq"> Where is registration of mobile station on a SIP server, what kind of billing options available with UmSITE?

</h2>
						  <center><p>With the current UmSITE software, a VoIP server does not receive SIP INVITE messages for GSM users, so a BTS system can:
                          <br>
1. Enable/disable users in the GSM core using a socket API.
<br>
2. Route all calls to a SIP server or a SIP proxy for billing purposes.
<br>
3. Route all SMS to an SMPP server for billing purposes.
 <br>
<a href="https://github.com/Rhizomatica/rccn">Here is an example of a system</a> that implements flat tariff plan for calls inside and per-minute for calls outside of the network.
<br>

We can help you do a non-standart configuration on demand and run a commercial network with more UmSITEs, in that case we suggest to discuss a commercial agreement to provide you support and network maintenance for upcharge price.

</h2>
						  <center><p> The code which generates the random number is <a href="http://cgit.osmocom.org/openbsc/tree/openbsc/src/libmsc/db.c?h=fairwaves/master#n1229">here</a>

But we strongly recommend you against modifying the code. We regularly roll-out updated code and you'll be losing your changes.

The recommended way of assigning numbers is by out of band means:
 <br>
1. You can create a simple web-portal for users to register at and claim their numbers.
<br>
2. Alternatively you can connect to OsmoNITB through SMPP and implement a special SMS number to claim numbers.
<br>
3. You can also intercept the first subscriber's call and play instruction how to claim the number.

</h2>
						  <center><p> Currently this is implemented only for the <u>token</u> authentication mode, but this mode it not recommended. It tried to kick users out of the network, which does not behave consistently for different phones. We would recommend to implement this through external means - e.g. by monitoring new user registrations on SMPP socket.

For the reference, code for the <u>token auth</u> located <a href="http://cgit.osmocom.org/openbsc/tree/openbsc/src/libmsc/token_auth.c?h=fairwaves/master">here</a>
