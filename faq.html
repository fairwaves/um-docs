						  <h2 class="faq">How does installation without a GPS antenna affect the system?</h2>
						  <center><p>We strongly recommend using a GPS antenna; however, it is possible to work without it, but it may cause problems with cell phone registration to the network in terms of surrounding GSM networks, cell phone model, temperature. Once the phone has registered to a network, GPS does not affect the productivity of the system at all.</p></center>

						  <h2 class="faq">Do you have specific SIM-cards or can any SIM-cards be used?

</h2>
						  <center><p>Fairwaves base station could be configured to work with any SIM-cards. However, it is impossible to provide subscriber authentication and traffic encryption if you do not know Ki secret key of your SIM-cards. If you operate a normal mobile network with encryption and subscriber authentication, you can only set up an open network and either get SIM-cards with known Ki keys or set up a closed network. </p></center>

						  <h2 class="faq">What is the capacity of the subscriber database?

</h2>
						  <center><p>A base station with one transceiver is able to handle from 200 (if you offer your subscribers a flat tariff with free local calls) to 500 subscribers (normal mode with tariffs still comfortable for subscribers). For example, with 10,000 subscribers, you will need around 20 base stations. Please note this is a very rough estimation.</p></center>

						  <h2 class="faq">How do you handle SMS and GPRS in your systems?

</h2>
						  <center><p> Fairwaves base stations are able to provide basic services: Voice and SMS. Also, Fairwaves provide GPRS; in terms of quality it is disabled in production systems to get more capacity for the voice and SMS that is too slow to use it as data service. We are considering using WiFi instead of GPRS.

</h2>

</h2>
						  <center><p>We do not support external BTS connection through A-bis interface, because this architecture is not fault-tolerant from the connection lost. It does not have local call switching, and there is no simple way of backhaul optimization, which brings extra expenses for the village connection through the VSAT.</p></center>

						  <h2 class="faq"> TRX0 frequency spectrum detected but TRX1 does not seem to be transmitting on the specified frequency. what could be the issue?

</h2>
						  <center><p>According to the GSM Standard, only TRX0 has to transmit constantly.
Secondary TRX's can transmit only when TRX0 would completely loaded.

So if you want to see transmission on the TRX1 you should either:
<br>
1. have more than 6 active call legs (more than 3 active calls)
<br>
2. set TRX0 configuration to SDCCH and leave TCH only on the TRX1 and make a call.
<br>
In other case you'll see that the transmission of TRX1 is not
continuous, unless you have all TCH's on TRX1.</p></center>

						  <h2 class="faq"> Where is registration of mobile station on a SIP server, what kind of billing options are available with UmSITE?

</h2>
						  <center><p>With the current UmSITE software, a VoIP server does not receive SIP INVITE messages for GSM users, so a BTS system can:
                          <br>
1. Enable/disable users in the GSM core using a socket API.
<br>
2. Route all calls to a SIP server or a SIP proxy for billing purposes.
<br>
3. Route all SMS to an SMPP server for billing purposes.
 <br>
<a href="https://github.com/Rhizomatica/rccn">Here is an example of a system</a> that implements flat tariff plan for calls inside and per-minute for calls outside the network.
<br>

We can help you do a non-standard configuration on demand and run a commercial network with more UmSITEs, in this case we suggest to discuss a commercial agreement to provide you support and network maintenance for upcharge price.

But we strongly recommend you not to modify the code. We regularly roll-out updated code and you'll be losing your changes.

The recommended way of assigning numbers is by out of band means:
 <br>
1. You can create a simple web-portal for users to register at and claim their numbers.
<br>
2. Alternatively you can connect to OsmoNITB through SMPP and implement a special SMS number to claim numbers.
<br>
3. You can also intercept the first subscriber's call and play instruction how to claim the number.

						  <center><p> Currently this is implemented only for the <u>token</u> authentication mode, but this mode it not recommended. It tried to kick users out of the network, which does not behave consistently for different phones. We would recommend to implement this through external means - e.g. by monitoring new user registrations on SMPP socket.

How to configure <a href="http://fairwaves.github.io/um-docs/soft_conf.html">SMPP</a> (5.7 SMPP Configuration), so you should implement a client for these purposes.

</h2>
						  <center><p> We do not install GPRS on BTS, but this is available on stack that we are using <a href="http://osmocom.org/">osmocom stack</a> 'How to' described <a href="http://fairwaves.github.io/um-docs/how_to's.html">here</a>
						  <br>
						  For example:
						  <br>
If the GPS trackers and BTS would situated in 550 sq/ft room, then you will be able to use CS-4 coding scheme that allows up to ~ 20 kbit/s on gsm channel timeslot. Basically 2 TRx channels of UmDesk/UmSite with 15 timeslots for traffic provides up to 300 kbit/s. According to it, you can count how many trackers might work under one BTS.
